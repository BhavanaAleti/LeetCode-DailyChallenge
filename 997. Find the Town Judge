#Soluition for https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/
# Think as a directed graph and we need to find a node where the indegree is n-1 and there is no outdegree from the node.
#Use a array for the n people, increase the indegree i.e; number of people trusting them, decrease for the outdegree because they don't trust themselfes.
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] tCount = new int[n+1];
        for(int[] t : trust){
            tCount[t[0]]--;
            tCount[t[1]]++;
        }
        for(int i =1; i< tCount.length; i++){
            if(tCount[i] ==(n-1)) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
